# Survivr2

## Project Overview
The Survivr2 project combines Ruby's object orientation and automated testing principles in a challenging and rewarding task. The project creates a simulation of the game Survivor, where contestants participate in challenges to be saved from elimination. Development will be Test Driven Development (TDD) with a series of files that contain tests and some empty files where the code resides.
